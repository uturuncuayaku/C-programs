Binary Heap Data Structures
-array object
-binary tree representation
-filled completely
-except, the lowest on occasion
-which is filled from left up to a point

Can implement things like priority queues and background jobs
Efficient storing, "heapsort"
Is a sorting algo that is based upon a binary heap data structure.
It involves finding the largest(max) elem and sorting it at the end
of an unsorted collection.

Binary Heap 
Insert - O(log n)
Delete - O(log n) 
Decrease key - O(log n)
Merge - O(n)
Extract min- theta (log n)
