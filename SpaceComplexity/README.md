# Space Complexity Topic
---
Formal definition- 
The amount of computer memory that is required during program execution as a function of input size. 
Space complexity is the amount of memory it needs to run to completion.

Space = Fixed + Variable parts.

Fixed: varies, space needed for storing instructions, variables, constants and structured variables [arrays, struct]
Variable: varies, includes space needed for stack and for structured variables that dynamically allocated during run time.

More definitions:
Space complexity is defined as the process of determining a formula for the production of how much memory space will be required for the successful execution of an algorithm. The memory space is the space of primary memory. Primary memory is computer memory that is accessed directly by the CPU. This includes several types of memory, consists of one or more memory modules that temporarily store data while a computer is running. It is also known as main memory, it will store the current data that is being worked on presently. Two types are random access memory and read only memory. Within random access memory types we have static and dynamic memory. Read only memory is another special memory bank that consists of programmable read only memory(PROM), erasable programmable read-only memory(EPROM) and electrically erasable programmable read only memory(EEPROM or E^2PROM). Secondary memory are known by common names such as SSD, CD, DVD, HDD and the like. 

Space complexity is usually expressed in big O notation. Big O notation is a fancy way of saying the push back of a function or formula as its values approach a certain value such as infinity or 1 or 2. Formula is said that its the limiting behavior of a function when the argument trends towards a particular value or infinity. Invented by Paul Bachmann and other mathemetician Edmund Landau. Big O is also called Bachmann-Landau notation or asymptotic notation.
